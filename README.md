FrequentItemSet.java - Total Number of Transaction ID's - 107500

Analysis - Bitwise (&) operator - Checking for Equality between two Strings in two distinct lists 

      Reading the raterID's of Amazon Transactions and mapping the unique raterId's to custom developed bit pattern and storing       the resulting items in Dictionary or list . The list values are compared using Bitwise & operator.
      
      The Time Taken to Execute - 53837 (milliseconds) - (53.837 seconds ) 

Analysis - EqualsIgnoreCase (String Class) - Checking for Equality between two Strings in two distinct lists 

      Reading the raterID's of Amazon Transactions and mapping the unique raterId's to custom developed binary bit pattern and        storing the resulting items in Dictionary or list . The list values are compared using EqualsIgnoreCase (String Class).
      
      The Time Taken to Execute - 149458 (milliseconds) - (149.458 seconds )

Analysis - CompareTo (Long Class) - Checking for Equality between two Long Values present in different lists

      Reading the raterID's of Amazon Transactions and mapping the unique raterId's to custom developed binary bit pattern .          The list values are converted to long value and compared using compareTo of the Long Class. 
      
      The Time Taken to Execute - 790948 (milliseconds) - (790.948 seconds )
